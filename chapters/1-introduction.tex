-> encryption


Motivation: secret key storage are attackable and the key can be read out with different techniques
-> PUFs provide a more save key storage against attacks
Protocols are based on PUFs
PUFs can be used for multiple purposes

% Done:
This thesis is structured as follows: 
Chap. \ref{cap:background} gives an introduction to \pufs and \ac{ML} attacks.
A more detailed description of important \ac{ML} attacks for this thesis is provided by Chap. \ref{cap:mla}.
\todo{put attack section ref in here}
Chap. \ref{cap:arbiter} explains the \apuf specifications before Chap. shows already applied attacks occurring in the current literature.
It is explained why only one of these attacks is relevant to the idea of \ac{MV} which then is introduced in Chap. \ref{cap:majorityarbiter} and counteracts this one attack.
To prove this in an empirical manner a simulation of the \apuf and the attack is build and described in Chap. \ref{cap:simulationdesign}.
The results of the simulations are laid out in Chap. \ref{cap:stabilitysimulation} and Chap. \ref{cap:attacksimulations}.
Finally a conclusion for the thesis is given in Chap. \ref{cap:conclusion}.
