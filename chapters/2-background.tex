\section{Physical unclonable functions}
\label{sec:pyhsicalunclonablefunctions}

Concept \cite{Suh2007PhysicalGeneration}
Definitions: unclonable, ...
% A Formal Foundation for the Security Features of Physical Functions
What are CPS
randomness, uniqueness and steadiness(robustness) \cite{CherifJouini2011PerformanceStatistics}

Definition by Armknecht

Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) offer a promising solution for future security problems [9].
\cite{Tajik2014PhysicalPUFs}

unclonability and unpredictability are the main PUF requirements [3, 22]
\cite{Tajik2014PhysicalPUFs}

"However, it was pointed out that most existing PUFs do not match the formal PUF models" (\cite{Becker2015ThePUFs}) -> \cite{Ruhrmair2013PUFsEvaluations}

\subsection{Classes of PUFs}

Optical, electric digital, electric analog
optical: Only optical PUFs have resisted all modeling attacks so far. We refer the reader to existing works [67], [70] and a recent survey paper on modeling attacks [68]. \cite{Ruhrmair2014PUFsGlance}

% On the foundations of physical unclonable functions
Strong, weak, ...  
% Strong PUFs: Models, Constructions, and Security Proofs
Strong: They assume that an adversary has collected a large number of all possible CRPs of a given Strong PUF (usually between several hundred to a few million CRPs, depending on the exact Strong PUF design). \cite{Ruhrmair2014PUFsGlance}

Delay based, memory based

settling-state-based PUFs and timing-based PUFs [15].
Arbiter and Ring-oscillator PUFs are two examples of timing-based PUFs [15]
\cite{Tajik2014PhysicalPUFs}

\cite{Becker2015ThePUFs}

\subsection{Current types of PUFs}

Butterfly, ...
\cite{Becker2015ThePUFs}

In the coating PUF [15], a silicon chip is covered with a randomized dielectric coating that affects the exact capacitance values of underlying metal sensors, leading again to unique and practically unclonable PUF responses. \cite{Armknecht2011AFunctions}

Lightweight PUFs \cite{Delvaux2014SecureImpossible}

Feed Forward Arbiter PUFs: Feed Forward Arbiter PUFs \cite{Ruhrmair2013PUFData}

Loop PUF proposed by: "Zouha Cherif Jouini, Jean-Luc Danger, Sylvain Guilley, and Lilian
Bossuet. An easy to design puf based on a single oscillator: the loop
puf."

\subsection{Application of PUFs}

\cite{Becker2015ThePUFs} NXP

PUFs can be utilized as the basis for many security applications, such as encryption [13, 29] and hardware fingerprinting [26, 33]
\cite{Tajik2014PhysicalPUFs}

against: Recently, fake IC (Integrated Circuit) chips are dis- tributed to market.
