%% Abstract

\begin{abstract}

This work shows possible attacks on current \apufs as well as further improvements of \apufs to resist these attacks.
\apufs have been successfully attacked with different machine learning approaches which makes them unsafe and leads to the question how to make them robust to these attacks.
Machine learning attacks in combination with a certain amount of \acp{CRP} made it so far possible to create models which can be used to calculate responses to new challenges.
Beside an overview of the different current attacks this work simulates attacks to compare their success on \apufs and the improved \mpufs.
\mpufs follow a new approach to make \apufs more robust and scaleable.

The simulation shows that the robustness of \apufs ascends magnificent with the new majority based approach....
