Special thanks should be given to Nils Wisiol and the members of the \puf work group for all encouragement and inspiration.

I would also like to thank the Freie Universit√§t Berlin and the HPC Team for giving access to the High Performance Computing resources.

Finally, I wish to thank my parents for their never ending support throughout my study and thank you to Laura Gindera, for all her love and understanding.
